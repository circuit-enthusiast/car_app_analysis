"NO","ISSUE","SEVERITY","DESCRIPTION","OPTIONS"
"1","App can be installed on a vulnerable unpatched Android versionAndroid 6.0-6.0.1, [minSdk=23]","high","This application can be installed on an older version of android that has multiple unfixed vulnerabilities. These devices won't receive reasonable security updates from Google. Support an Android version => 10, API 29 to receive reasonable security updates.","Suppression the rule vulnerable_os_version in com.honda.hondalink.connect"
"2","Clear text traffic is Enabled For App[android:usesCleartextTraffic=true]","high","The app intends to use cleartext network traffic, such as cleartext HTTP, FTP stacks, DownloadManager, and MediaPlayer. The default value for apps that target API level 27 or lower is ""true"". Apps that target API level 28 or higher default to ""false"". The key reason for avoiding cleartext traffic is the lack of confidentiality, authenticity, and protections against tampering; a network attacker can eavesdrop on transmitted data and also modify it without being detected.","Suppression the rule clear_text_traffic in com.honda.hondalink.connect"
"3","App has a Network Security Configuration[android:networkSecurityConfig=@xml/network_security_config]","info","The Network Security Configuration feature lets apps customize their network security settings in a safe, declarative configuration file without modifying app code. These settings can be configured for specific domains and for a specific app.","Suppression the rule has_network_security in com.honda.hondalink.connect"
